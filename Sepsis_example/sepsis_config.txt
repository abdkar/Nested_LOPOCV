scaling:
  scaler: "StandardScaler"                # Critical for vital signs with different scales

# Job control optimized for clinical data processing
job_control:

  internal_n_jobs: 4                      # Parallel model training

# Hardware settings
hardware:

# Model selection optimized for clinical prediction
models:
  selected:
    - "Random Forest"                     # Excellent for clinical data, interpretable
    - "XGBoost"                          # High performance for structured data
    - "Logistic Regression"              # Interpretable, clinical standard
    - "LightGBM"                         # Fast, good performance
    # Additional models for comparison:
    # - "AdaBoost"                       # Ensemble method
    # - "Gradient Boosting Classifier"   # Traditional boosting

# Sepsis datasets (hourly measurements from ICU patients)
file_indices: [10, 20, 30]               # Start with smaller datasets

# Validation strategy thresholds (adjusted for clinical data)
validation:
  min_participants_lopo: 2                # Minimum patients for LOPOCV
  min_participants_group3: 3              # Minimum patients for Group 3-fold
  min_samples_per_class: 10               # Minimum septic hours for 10-fold

# Clinical-specific settings
clinical:
  # Focus on early detection (within 6 hours of sepsis onset)
  early_detection_window: 6               # Hours before sepsis onset
  
  # Imbalanced data handling (sepsis is relatively rare)
  handle_imbalance: true                  # Use class weighting
  
  # Missing data strategy (common in ICU due to equipment issues)
  missing_data_strategy: "forward_fill"   # Realistic for continuous monitoring

# Clinical performance metrics priorities
metrics:
  primary: "sensitivity"                  # Early detection is critical
